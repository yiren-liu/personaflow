# Security Policy

## üîí Our Commitment to Security

PersonaFlow takes security seriously. We appreciate the security research community's efforts to help us maintain a secure platform for researchers and developers. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of PersonaFlow:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Best effort     |

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Immediate Response Required

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue. Instead, please report it privately using one of the following methods:

### Preferred Method: Private Security Advisory

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/your-username/personaflow/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with detailed information

### Alternative Method: Email

Send an email to: **security@personaflow.com** (if available) or create a private issue.

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Affected component** (Frontend, Backend, Database, API)
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** and attack scenarios
- **Suggested remediation** (if you have ideas)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

## ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We are committed to responding quickly to security reports:

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| **Initial Response** | Within 24 hours |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Within 3 business days |
| **Fix Development** | Varies by severity |
| **Security Release** | ASAP after fix completion |
| **Public Disclosure** | 90 days after fix, or coordinated disclosure |

## üèÜ Security Hall of Fame

We recognize and appreciate security researchers who help improve PersonaFlow's security:

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Environment Security
- **Never commit API keys** or sensitive credentials to version control
- **Use strong passwords** for database and service accounts
- **Enable two-factor authentication** on all external services
- **Regularly rotate API keys** and access tokens
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration

#### Deployment Security
- **Use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Monitor for security advisories** for dependencies
- **Use proper database security** (encryption at rest, secure connections)
- **Implement proper access controls** for production systems

#### Data Protection
- **Limit data collection** to what's necessary for functionality
- **Encrypt sensitive data** both in transit and at rest
- **Implement proper backup security** measures
- **Follow data retention policies**

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Validate all inputs** from users and external APIs
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
- **Follow secure coding practices** for your language
- **Regular security code reviews**

#### Dependencies
- **Keep dependencies updated** to latest secure versions
- **Audit dependencies** for known vulnerabilities
- **Use dependency scanning tools** in CI/CD
- **Pin dependency versions** for reproducible builds

#### API Security
- **Implement rate limiting** on all endpoints
- **Use proper authentication tokens** (JWT with secure practices)
- **Validate and sanitize** all API inputs
- **Implement proper CORS policies**
- **Use HTTPS only** for API communication

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth** for user authentication
- **JWT tokens** for API authentication
- **Role-based access control** for different user types
- **Secure session management**

### Data Protection
- **Encryption in transit** (HTTPS/TLS)
- **Encryption at rest** (database encryption)
- **Secure API key storage** (environment variables)
- **Input validation** and sanitization

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container security** best practices
- **Network segmentation** in Docker
- **Secure default configurations**
- **Regular security updates**

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Database security configured
- [ ] API rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Logging configured securely
- [ ] Dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security headers configured

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Dependencies updated monthly
- [ ] Security patches applied promptly
- [ ] Access logs reviewed
- [ ] API keys rotated quarterly
- [ ] Security assessments performed
- [ ] Backup integrity verified

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### API Keys and External Services
PersonaFlow integrates with several external APIs:
- **OpenAI API**: Requires secure API key management
- **Semantic Scholar API**: API key should be protected
- **Supabase**: Database credentials and service keys
- **Google Services**: Service account credentials

### Data Handling
- **Research data**: May contain sensitive academic information
- **User conversations**: Chat logs and research discussions
- **Literature data**: Academic papers and metadata

### Network Security
- **CORS policies**: Properly configured for frontend-backend communication
- **API endpoints**: Protected against unauthorized access
- **WebSocket connections**: Secure real-time communication
